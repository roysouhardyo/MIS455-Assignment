      The International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD), the
      Outreach, Extension and Continuing Education (OECE) unit of the Office of
      the Pro-Vice Chancellor and the Department of Environmental Science and
      Management (DESM) at Independent University, Bangladesh (IUB), organized
      the second cohort of a short course titled “Locally Led Adaptation and
      Local Loss and Damage: A Nexus Approach.” The four-day program, held from
      September 30 to October 3, 2024, brought together 30 participants from
      academic and professional backgrounds across Bangladesh. Participants,
      including lecturers, researchers, and professionals from institutions such

      Technology, engaged in six sessions exploring key aspects of Locally Led
      Adaptation (LLA) in the context of climate change. The course covered the
      evolution of LLA from Community-based Adaptation (CBA), discussed its core
      principles, and addressed the practical applications of LLA in mitigating
      both economic and non-economic losses. Special focus was placed on
      Nature-based Solutions (NbS) and the challenges of scaling LLA globally.
