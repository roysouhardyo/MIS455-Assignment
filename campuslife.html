      All students enrolled at IUB are required to participate in a
      four/three-credit course called Live-in-Field Experience (LFE). This
      course holds a unique place in Bangladesh's education system, with its
      origins tracing back to social thinkers of our subcontinent in the early
      part of this century. In essence, its purpose is to impart a deep
      understanding of the socio-economic realities prevailing in rural
      Bangladesh to young minds.

      JUKTI is the official club of the Department of Computer Science and
      Engineering (CSE) at the Independent University, Bangladesh (IUB). This
      club is the brainchild of the honorable Dean of the School of Engineering
      and Computer Science- the late Dr. Ali Shihab Sabbir. Our primary mission
      is to act as a liaison between the students and the Department of
      Engineering by helping the tutees recognize the steps they should take to
      establish a career and build a skill set outside of academics.
